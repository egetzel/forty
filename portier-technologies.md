				<h2>Background</h2>
			</header>
      <p><i><a href="http://goportier.com">Portier Technologies</a> is a hotel and data analytics company based in Hong Kong that helps luxury five star hotels in SE Asia to engage their guest and drive revenue using white labelled Samsung devices available in guest bedrooms.</i></p>
			<p>In 2019, Portier Technologies was expanding rapidly and needed support to help bring together and support and connect different sides of the business from sales and marketing to product and technology. This case study will outline how I helped them to:
	    <ul>
	    <li>Support their sales teams</li>
	    <li>Revamp their marketing branding and messaging</li>
	    <li>Help hotel GMs better understand how to engage their guests</li>
	    </ul></p>

				<p>Because New Context was a consulting company, it's ability to generate additional revenue and grow was dependant on it being able to hire new Engineers. Additionally, any time that other engineers used interview candidates was time that they could not be billing the clients.

				As a result, executives were extremely interested in the process and reporting of the hiring process.</p>

					<h3>Persona</h3>
				</header>
				<p>I started by identifying a user persona that I would target and reach out to on LinkedIn.
				<ul>
					<li>Working for companies with good DevOps practices (Apollo Group, Cerner)</li>
					<li>Working in cities with limited DevOps opportunities (Phoenix, Kansas City)</li>
					<li>Had connections to exisiting team members</li>
				</ul></p>
				<header class="major">
					<h3>Process</h3>
				</header>
				<p>Once, I had a target persona, I set out to design and recruiting process and work flow that:
				<ul>
					<li>Responsive and agile to business needs</li>
					<li>Minimized time required of existing engineers</li>
					<li>Respectful of candidates time</li>
					<li>Cost effective - recruiting can get expensive</li>
				</ul></p>
				<header class="major">
					<h3>Product</h3>
				</header>
					<p>To track each step of the hiring process, I used Salesforce to build an applicant tracking system because:</p>
				<ul>
					<li>C-Suite was already spending a lot of time in Salesforce</li>
					<li>Easy to generate forms for engineers to give feedback</li>
					<li>Build in capability to create hiring dashboards and reports</li>
				</ul>

					<h2>Results</h2>
				</header>
				<p>After six months of recruiting we were able to:
				<ul>
					<li>Hire 16 Sr DevOps and Security Engineers</li>
					<li>Each hire cost roughly $1600 per hire</li>
					<li>Hire and onboard all engineers on an average of 3.5 weeks per hire</li>
				</ul></p>
